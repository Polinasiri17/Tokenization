# Hugging Face Tokenizer Demo using Gradio

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how a **Hugging Face Transformer tokenizer (BERT)** works by converting input text into **tokens and token IDs**.  
A simple and interactive **Gradio web interface** is used to make the tokenizer easy to explore for beginners.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Does
- Accepts user text as input
- Tokenizes the text using **BERT (bert-base-uncased)**
- Displays:
  - Tokenized words
  - Corresponding token IDs
- Runs as a lightweight web app using **Gradio**

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- BERT Tokenizer (`bert-base-uncased`)
- Gradio

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User enters a sentence in the textbox
2. The text is processed using Hugging Face’s BERT tokenizer
3. Tokens and token IDs are displayed instantly

## ▶ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install transformers gradio
